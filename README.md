A quiz about me

My goal is to create a quiz with 20 questions on a topic of my choice. Each question must have 4 possible answers with only one of them being correct!

I made use of these programming languages :
html5
css
php
github(to create a repository and commit) 

I did a research for possible questions i can use to make a 20 question quiz.
I used them and came up with my own possible answers because the quiz is a personal questionnaire .
I inserted a image as my background for styling 
I used two different google fonts 
I used the if function for the score for every submit 
I used the count++ variable to calculate the correct answers 
I also used emoticons to style and attract people 

To complete the quiz you have to install wamp,xamp or mamp 
use the localhost to view the questionnaire and omplete the quiz .
